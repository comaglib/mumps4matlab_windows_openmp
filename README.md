The folders pre_compiled_version_windows and pre_compiled_version_linux provide the pre-compiled versions, which can be run directly in MATLAB.

README_ENGLISH and README_CHINESE provide detailed compilation procedures. If you need to compile it yourself, please refer to the instructions in these files.

The src folder contains the original MUMPS_5.7.2 source files and the configuration files used during the compilation process. You can base your own compilation efforts on the contents of this folder.

The all_files_compiled folder contains all the compiled files. If you compile the solver yourself, you can use the contents of this folder for comparison and reference.

The test folder provides several test files.
